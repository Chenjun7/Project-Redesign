                <br/>
                <p>Under strict rules, limited time and resources, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, 
                design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field 
                game against like-minded competitors. Itâ€™s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get.
